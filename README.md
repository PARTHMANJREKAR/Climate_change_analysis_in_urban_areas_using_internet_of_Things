# Climate Change Analysis in Urban Areas Using IoT 🌍

## Project Overview 🚀

Climate change is reshaping our world, and urban areas are feeling the heat! This cutting-edge IoT project is designed to track environmental changes in real-time, creating a smart network of sensors to monitor air quality and weather conditions across western coastal India. Over three years, our system will collect data every 10 minutes, providing deep insights into urban climate dynamics and pollution trends.

## Hardware Components 🔬

Our intelligent monitoring system is powered by state-of-the-art components:

🧠 ESP32: The brain behind the operation, handling data processing and cloud connectivity.

🌫 Gas Sensors:

MQ-2: Sniffs out CH4 (methane), CO (carbon monoxide), and smoke.

MQ-7: Focuses on CO levels.

MQ-135: Tracks CO2 concentration for air quality assessment.

🌡 BMP280 Sensor: Measures atmospheric pressure to track weather changes.

💧 DHT-11 Sensor: Keeps an eye on temperature and humidity.

⚡ Power System:

Rechargeable battery pack for sustainability.

Mini solar panel for eco-friendly power generation.

Backup battery charged by solar cells to ensure uninterrupted operation.

Low-power cooling fans to regulate internal temperature.

🏺 Enclosure:

3D-printed cylindrical casing with airflow vents inspired by Indian cultural symbols, merging tradition with technology.

🏙 System Architecture

📡 Data Collection:

Sensors continuously capture air quality, temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure.

Each reading is timestamped for precision.

## Cloud Storage ☁ 

Data is securely transmitted to a cloud database in real-time.

## Smart Sensor Network 🔗

Devices are strategically placed throughout the city, forming an interconnected monitoring grid.

## Data Analysis & Insights 📊

After three years of data collection, AI-driven analytics will uncover hidden trends.

Graphs, heatmaps, and visual reports will provide a clear picture of urban climate evolution.

The final report will empower policymakers and researchers with actionable insights.

## Expected Impact 🌟

Real-time pollution tracking for smarter urban planning.

Identification of temperature and humidity fluctuations over time.

A deeper understanding of climate change effects in densely populated areas.

Support for sustainable policies and green initiatives.

## Project Timeline ⏳

📅 Duration: 3 years

⏱ Data Collection Frequency: Every 10 minutes

## Future Possibilities 🔮

Expanding the sensor network to other cities for broader climate studies.

AI-powered predictive analytics to anticipate environmental shifts.

Collaborating with environmental organizations to drive impactful policy changes.
